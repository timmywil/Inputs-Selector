A 5-line plugin that creates a selector for selecting any type of input element in a cross-browser way.
ex: $('input:inputs(text)').hide();  
In most browsers, $('input[type=text]').doSomething() would work just fine, but not in IE! 
The alternative is you could add classes to all the elements you want and select them that way, but this is just a very short timesaver.

$('tag:inputs(arg)')

The tag's 'type' attribute will be checked against 'arg'.
